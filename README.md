This project predicts the median value of houses in Boston using machine learning. The dataset contains various features such as crime rate, number of rooms, property tax rate, pupil–teacher ratio, and other socio-economic factors. After handling missing values and scaling the features, the data is split into training and testing sets. A Linear Regression model is trained to predict house prices, and its performance is evaluated using RMSE and R² score. The results are also visualized through an Actual vs Predicted plot and an Error Distribution plot. This project demonstrates the end-to-end process of regression analysis, from preprocessing to model evaluation and visualization.
