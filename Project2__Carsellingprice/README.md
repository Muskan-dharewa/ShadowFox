The app uses features such as fuel type, seller type, transmission, kilometers driven, years of service, present price, and number of previous owners.

The dataset includes columns like Car_Name, Year, Selling_Price, Present_Price, Kms_Driven, Fuel_Type, Seller_Type, Transmission, and Owner.  
To run the app, use the following command:
